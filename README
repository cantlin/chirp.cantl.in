This is a simple example application for unfollowing people on Twitter. It's a work in progress.

You can play with it at http://chirp.cantl.in. At this stage it will probably break horribly in anything but Google Chrome.

OK things:

  * memcached API requests
  * only uses the oauth ruby lib, not the oauth-plugin or twitter gems
  * cute jQuery UI
  * near-complete i18n
  * salty cookies (ew)

Things I'm fixing:

  * External Twitter users aren't modelled (i.e. those who have never logged in)
  * users#update will respond to any arbitrary method (probably with an uncaught NoMethodError)
  * JSON::ParseErrors are not handled (if Twitter goes down, so do we)
  * Users following more than a hundred people won't see them all

Things I probably won't fix for this project:

  * Tests!
  * Horrible JS hack for "dismissed" notifications
  * Unfollowing like a hundred people would, like, probably explode it

Things I'm adding:

  * Search
