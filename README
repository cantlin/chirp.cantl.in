This is a simple example application for unfollowing people on Twitter. Play with it at http://chirp.cantl.in.

There are a couple of things to fix still:

  * JSON::ParseErrors are not handled (if Twitter goes down, so do we)
  * Users following more than a hundred people won't see them all

Some things probably won't get fixed:

  * Tests!
  * Vomit inducing hack for "dismissed" notifications
