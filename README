There are a few of things to fix still:

  * JSON::ParseErrors are not handled (if Twitter goes down, so do we)
  * Users following more than a hundred people won't see them all
  * Users followed by the current user show up as unfollowed in search results

Some things probably won't get fixed:

  * Tests!
  * Vomit inducing hack for "dismissed" notifications
